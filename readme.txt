Highlight new posts for returning visitors.

== Description ==

= Highlight New Posts =

This plugin highlights new posts for your (returning) visitors. Posts that were published after the most recent visit
by your visitor get a "NEW" label appended to their title. It's a great way to help users find new content and to increase your pageviews.

= Why Highlight New Posts for Returning Visitors? =

Returning visitors are usually users who like your content and come back looking for more. However most of these users only spend a few seconds on a web page and leave if they donâ€™t find anything interesting.

By highlighting new content, you can point their attention to the latest content. This will not only help you increase your pageviews, but it will also help users find new content.
